# Reddit Sport Stream Finder

This script searches through a user defined subreddit and then looks for the match thread based on the team you give. It then returns the first link found in the match thread

## Website Adaption

This folder is the code I created to adapt the script for my website. I use WSGI as the interface between my web server and the web application. I am using Flask as the framework and I am using axios as my library for the aysnchronous web calls. I am using react-redux on the front ent to handle the response from my api.
This version does work but only returns the very first link in the match thread.
